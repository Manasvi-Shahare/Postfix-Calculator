# Postfix-Calculator

This is a basic precision POSTFIX calculator.
It performs functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
It also performs power and modulus.
It performs basic trignometric functions like sin, cos and tan.
All these functions are performed by postfix.
It works only when number of operators is less than number of operands.
It does not take care of negative numbers in multiplication and division.
For trignometric functions, one space is left after function(eg sin 45 and not sin45).
It doesn't take care of decimal numbers.
